## Description
PLUM - Professional Lending Under-worn Materials is a clothing/accessories renting service.<br>
<br>
This is a start-up idea that stemmed from the fact that the pandemic was ending and therefore events had begun to take place, which meant attendees would have to dress up in formal outfits. However, either due to the pandemic or a small wardrobe, people may not have the clothing needed for the event that they are going to. Hence, arises the opportunity, where seldom worn outfits that often end up being stored in the closet indefinitely may be listed on a platform, to either be rented out or to be sold off.
